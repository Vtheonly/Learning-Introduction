To enhance your React tutorial by adding more labs to each chapter (assuming "chatpetr" was a typo for "chapter"), I‚Äôve expanded the original lab ideas with additional hands-on exercises. Below is a detailed index for each section of your React tutorial, including the original labs plus new ones to ensure learners get comprehensive practice with the concepts covered. Each chapter includes at least five lab ideas to provide ample opportunity for hands-on learning.
